## This is my First Milestone Project (User Centric Frontend Development) for the Code Institute. I have created a portfolio website for a film composer / record producer under the alias 'Fitz'.

# User Experience Design (UX)

## Project Goals and Objectives

-   ### Users

    -   #### User's Goals
        1. As a User, I want to quickly and easily identify if the site's owner will be suitable for my project.
        2. As a User, I want to be able to quickly and easily navigate the site to find suitable content that will aid my decision.
        3. As a User, I want to be able to quickly and easily contact the site's owner for a project.

    -   #### Returning User's Goals
        1. As a Returning User, I want to find more information about the different services offered.
        2. As a Returning User, I want to find out about more information about the site owner's skills and experience.
        3. As a Returning User, I want to find out what previous clients and co-workers think of the site's owner.

    -   #### Frequent User's Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to see if there are any newly added work examples, photos and reviews.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if the site's owner offers any new services.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to have a section where I can sign up for newsletter, so I can get the latest offers and news from the site's owner.

-   ### Owner

    -   #### Owner's Goals
        1. As the Owner, I want Users to contact me for a project using the contact form.
        2. As the Owner, I want to present my services and skills in the best of light.
        3. As the Owner, I want to work on a variety of interesting projects.
        4. As the Owner, I want Users to connect with me on social media and subscribe to my newsletter.

## Design Choices

-   ### Website

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are charcoal for background, gray for foreground contrast, off-white for main text and subtitles and yellow important text and titles / headings.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Lato is the primary font for headings and Roboto the secondary font for paragraphs with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case they aren't being imported into the site correctly.

    -   #### Layout
        -   Due to the simplicity and nature of the project, I decided to create a single-page scrolling website as it created a smoother user-experience with an easier navigation.
        - CSS grid was used to structure the website as it allowed me to easily place all the elements in the page and make them fully responsive without the use of bootstrap.
        - I originally created a 16-column grid, which works similar to bootstrap but since the project is simple without too many elements, I decided to use fixed grid-template-areas based on my wireframe.

    -   #### Landing Page
        -   A full screen background image related to the site owner with a dark overlay is used to create a modern and engaging first experience as well as give emphasis to the titles and text.
        -   A catchy header title is used as an effective call to action.
        -   Quotes from the owner are used to make the site feel more personal.
        - A clear distinction between the 2 buttons, with the contact owner button having the superiority.

-   ### Wireframes
    - Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes
    - Wireframes for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop - [View](https://xd.adobe.com/view/14523a83-8524-4f79-9d3e-505503a9e2f0-4101/)
