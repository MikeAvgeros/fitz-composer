        -   The main colours used are charcoal, white and yellow.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Mukta Vaani and Roboto fonts are used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

    -   #### Landing Page
        -   A full screen, muted, loopable video related to the site owner is used to create a modern and engaging first experience.
        -   A catchy header title is used as an effective call to action.
        -   Quotes from the owner are used to make the site feel more personal.

-   ### Wireframes
